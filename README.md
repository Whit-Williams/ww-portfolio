# Whitney Williams - Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio page! 

As I gain more experience in the world of Front-End Development, this page will develop with me, showcasing all of the projects I come to work on. 

It will also offer the opportunity to get to know the person behind the code (aka me), and find out how you can get in touch.
